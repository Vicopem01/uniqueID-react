# Unique ID onine srudy website
This project is one of the best projecrs I've worked on and I enjoyed every bit of it.

## I was given a figma design to work alongside 
[The Figma Link](https://www.figma.com/file/AlL1VZQII3M2QjrguNAPsC/UniqueIQ?node-id=82%3A32)

##This project was built completely with React JS and pure CSS as desired by client 

### Used React Router to route all pages together and for faster speed
 While using router, had to lazy load all major components to reduce the heavy load on browsers trying to render all Javascript files at once and instead called for only the scripts it needed while caching the scripts it had already called.
 
 
## Extras
In the course of working on this project, a lot of additional functions were added by me.

###The loading page
* Added a loading page to keep users engaged while things run in the background
* Added an error page for catching errrors in page links and redirecting users back to the home page
* Adjustments font sizes for better page usage
* Routed all pages for better speed
* Lazy loaded all major components to reduce browser load
